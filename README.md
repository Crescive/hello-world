First repository on GitHub.

# Welcome To My GitHub!
Hello, softwarer developers, hobbyists, and just plain dudes. Welcome to my GitHub account, where I will store all of my code for minor or major projects that I may undertake in the foreseeable future. 

## About Me
Right now, I am a programming hobbyist with no major accomplishments under my belt. This may be because I think I lack knowledge or constntly run into problems during development (CSS styling, I'm lookin' at you...), but due to some recent advice (*"Just do it, and you'll learn along the way what you need"* - Super Cool Anonymous Guy) I will be undertaking a small project that is kind of like a personal website about myself, and any projects I have and whatnot. When it is up and running, I hope you will visit it.

### Current Skills In Programming
* Languages
    * HTML5 (Pretty Decent)
    * CSS3 (Pretty Decent)
    * C# (Quite decent)
    * JavaScript (Okay, I guess)
    * C++ (Complete beginner)
    * Python (Okay, I guess)
    
 # The End
 I hope you enjoyed this small description of me! Thank you for reading, and happy coding (and collaborating or whatever). 
 
 ###### Small Note
 If you can leave any resource links or some helpful tips in general, It would be really appreciated. Maybe I could compile them into a tips and tricks repository at some point!
